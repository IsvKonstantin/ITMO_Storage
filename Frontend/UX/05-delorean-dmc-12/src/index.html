            The authorities arrested a man they said had slashed a giant balloon of a baby Donald
            Trump that was on display to protest the president’s visit to a football game in Alabama
            on Saturday. The man, Hoyt Hutchinson, 32, was arrested after officers in Tuscaloosa,
            Ala., saw him cut the balloon and then try to flee at about 1 p.m. on Saturday, the
            police said on Facebook. It wasn’t clear what Mr. Hutchinson had used to slash the
            balloon.

            <blockquote class="section__quote"
              >“I am going down here to make a scene, so y’all watch the news,” Mr. Hutchinson said
              in a Facebook Live video before the game.
            </blockquote>

            The balloon, which stands 20 feet tall and 13 feet wide when fully inflated, had been
            set up at a protest at Monnish Park. Mr. Trump attended the game about a mile away at
            Bryant-Denny Stadium to watch the University of Alabama and Louisiana State University
            face off. Mr. Hutchinson was charged with first-degree criminal mischief, the police
            said. He was taken to Tuscaloosa County Jail, posted $2,500 bond and watched the game’s
            third quarter, The Tuscaloosa News reported. (Louisiana State won, 46-41.) Mr.
            Hutchinson set up a GoFundMe account, “Restitutions for Baby Trump Stabber,” to raise
            money for his legal fees.

            <blockquote class="section__quote"
              >“Hoyt made sure our beloved president didn’t have to see this disrespectful balloon
              on the streets of Ttown today!!” the page says.
            </blockquote>
            As of Sunday morning, more than $20,000 had been donated. Mr. Hutchinson could not be
            immediately reached on Sunday.

            A different GoFundMe campaign called “Get Baby Trump to Tuscaloosa” had drawn more than
            $7,000 to have the balloon at the protest. Organizers said it cost about $4,000 to bring
            the balloon, anchor it and staff it.

            The orange balloon depicting Mr. Trump has its mouth agape, sports a white diaper and
            has a cellphone in one hand. The balloon and its replicas often appear in protests at
            places the president visits.

              >“It wouldn’t be a big Gameday in Tuscaloosa without a blimp overhead, so let’s make

            The balloon is one of six made available by the nonprofit group People’s Motorcade, its
            president, Jim Girvan, said on Sunday. He said he did not believe the Tuscaloosa balloon
            could be saved. “It’s a rather large gash,” Mr. Girvan said of a slit that runs about
            eight feet horizontally along the diaper line. “Some cuts can be repaired, but this one
            looks to be too big.” The five other balloons are at their home base in Somerset County,
            N.J.; in West Palm Beach, Fla., near the president’s private resort Mar-a-Lago;
            Wilmington, N.C., and Los Angeles. The balloons are replicas of the one that floated
            over London last year during Mr. Trump’s visit to the United Kingdom. It returned to
            London this year.
